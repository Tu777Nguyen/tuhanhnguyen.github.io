  desc: I worked on technogology and science for over 4 years, with mainly focus on teaching and developing in the field of electrical engineering. Now I am motivated to explore the new era of AI, Data Science and IoT to pursue new challenges, knowledge and oportunities. Put hard skills aside, I was trained to be a good communicator and team player from the previous job, plus the logic thinking, researching skill for new technologies. # Describe yourself.
